# heart_rate_sentinel_server_Lennox20190405

This server can be found at:
http://vcm-9030.vm.duke.edu:5000/


This server stores heart rate data on a database for multiple patients. It can return the following:
*The latest heart rate
*All heart rates since the initialization of the patient
*The average of all heart rates
*The average of all heart rates since a given timestamp

The client function has been added to Github in case of any syntax discrepancies

NOTE: The virtual machine has been tested using the patient_id of 1. Some extraneous data may still be stored on the database.
